        The thesis intends to experiment with the idea of a social-media form of participatory planning process where normal citizens 
        can participate in the discussion and design of a new development within designated heritage conservation area without being limited by their time schedule and location. 
        This survey will observe how these discussions on design proposals are carried out and how the result of these discussions will lead to the modification of an existing design
        as well as a shift in heritage conservation approach.

             4.) Do you think this building should or should not be conserved? What aspect of the building is allowed to be changed if it were to be conserved?  <br>
